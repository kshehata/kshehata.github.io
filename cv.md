## Teaching

* NUS CS2040C Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, Aug to Nov 2023,
  Jan to April 2024, Prof. Holun (Alan) Cheng

    * Enabled students to use any platform for their assignments and
    practical examination by rewriting assignments to use CMake and
    googletests.

    * Updated course materials to be more problem-based and have
    students work in teams during tutorials rather than tradition
    lecture-oriented tutorials.

    * These efforts resulted in students being able to explore the
    core DS&A material themselves, engage in active learning, and
    ultimately own their learning experience.

    * As head TA, coordinated with the TA team to ensure consistent
    delivery of course materials and grading standards.


* NUS CS4230/5430 Foundations of Modern Cryptography, Jan to April
2023, Prof. Prashant Vasudevan

    * Prepared and presented tutorials to students on relevant
    background material needed to understand lectures.

    * Topics included: complexity theory, security arguments, hybrid
    arguments, interactive proofs, group, number, and probability
    theory.

* NUS CS3235 Computer Security, Jan to April 2021 and 2022, Prof.
Prateek Saxena

    * Prepared and presented tutorial materials on security
    modelling, cryptography, and number theory.

    * Prepared and adapted assignments to online learning,
    including setting up autograding and randomized problem
    generation scripts.

    * Awarded Teaching Excellence and Teaching Fellowship awards for
    excellence in teaching.
