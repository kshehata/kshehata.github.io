Hi, I'm Kareem! I'm passionate about the discovery, synthesis,
dissemination of knowledge (i.e. learning new things, putting
together different bits of learning, and sharing that knowledge with
others). I'm always learning, whether in my core research on
cryptography, learning languages, or dog training. I'm currently
pursuing a PhD under [Prateek
Saxena](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prateeks/) at National
University of Singapore, School of Computing's [Crystal
Centre](https://www.crystal.comp.nus.edu.sg/), with a focus on
applied cryptography and theoretical computer science. I am to make
the world, or at least the internet, a better and more private place
by building cryptographic tools that are more practical than what we
had before.

In addition to research, I also love teaching and sharing knowledge.
I've recently been awarded the NUS School of Computing Teaching
Fellowship for excellence in teaching, and was a Teaching Assistant
to [Prashan
Vasudevan](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prashant/research.html) for
[CS4230/5430 Foundations of Modern
Cryptography](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~prashant/teaching/CS5430/).

In addition to my [CV](/cv/) and a list of my [talks](/talks/) and
[publications](/publications/), you'll find a [blog](/blog/) where I sometimes
write things.
